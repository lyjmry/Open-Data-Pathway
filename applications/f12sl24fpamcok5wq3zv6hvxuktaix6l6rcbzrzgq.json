    "Brief history of your project and organization": "We come from Doudiandou Data Technology. Our team is dedicated to the Filecoin field, providing users with solutions for storage, data processing, data encryption, and offering basic hardware infrastructure services. The cumulative computing power of the SPS we have collaborated with exceeds 300PiB and is still increasing. We have rich experience in data packaging and Filecoin node operation and maintenance.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "This release consists of simulated data products designed to mimic observations of the same region of the sky as seen by two astronomical facilities: the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We use AWS-CLI to obtain the file list from the aws cloud, and then use script commands to save the files to the local server. Package the data into a car file according to the set size without changing the directory structure of the original dataset. It is distributed to SP via hard disk mail and http. Then issue the order through boost.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://nasa-irsa-simulations/openuniverse2024/roman/  87.03582 TiB\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://nasa-irsa-simulations/openuniverse2024/rubin/ 283.5524 TiB",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03315260 Germany\nf03619143 HongKong\nf03619150 Singapore\nf03559187 United States\nf03099666 Brazil\nf03100007 HongKong\nf03100006 HongKong\nf03542777 Vietnam",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
