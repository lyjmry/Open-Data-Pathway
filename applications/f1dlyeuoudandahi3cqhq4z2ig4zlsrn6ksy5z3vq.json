    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We used the Go language to develop a set of tools that automatically download, cut, package data, and place orders. The tool will download the data set file from AWS, package the data set into a car file of the corresponding size by setting parameters such as sector size, and then distribute the car file to each SP through bandwidth and hard disk mail. Then, we use Boost to issue orders offline to let the SP start packaging using the Lotus program.",
